# **MCT1**

**MCT1** is a plugin, made using **Magikcraft**, for **Minecraft** that simulates _Type 1 Diabetes_ to educate children about their or their friend's **Diabetes**.

## What is _Type 1 Diabetes_?

_Type 1 Diabetes_ occurs when the bodyâ€™s immune system attacks its own pancreas and is irreversible. This attack is known as autoimmune disease. Because of the pancreas being attacked **Insulin** production is halted. **Insulin** is the hormone that serves as a key to open your cells to allow the glucose to enter and allow the use of glucose for energy. Without **Insulin** the glucose stays and builds up in the blood and this starves the cells. 

_Type 1 diabetes_ is distinct from _Type 2 Diabetes_. Unlike _Type 2 Diabetes_, _Type 1 Diabetes_ is not a life style disease and is irreversible.

## Before you start
 
 Before you start using **MCT1** you will need a few things set up:

* You need a **Minecraft** account from Mojang. You can get this from [www.minecraft.net](www.minecraft.net). If you have an Australian credit card you might not be able to pay for an account. You can use PayPal or buy a gift card from your local supermarket or 7/11.

* You need a **Minecraft** client. You can use both Mojang's Minecraft client and our own Magikcraft client. If you use the Mojang client you need to create a profile with the correct version of **Minecraft** and enter the MCT1 server details. The Magikcraft client comes preconfigured with the servers for MCT1 and is automatically set to the correct version. You can download the magikcraft client form [client.magikcraft.io](http://client.magikcraft.io).

* You need a GitHub account. Open a GitHub account for free at [www.github.com](http://www.github.com) and make sure that you verify your email by clicking on the link that GitHub sends to you.

## Set up MCT1

* Use your GitHub account to login to the Magikcraft Spellbook at [play.magikcraft.io](https://play.magikcraft.io). This is where you will set up the code for MCT1.

### Enable MCT1

* Put your mouse over your user profile picture and click on "Manage Plugins" in the menu that pops up. You will get a screen that says "`Enabled plugin: package.json`".

* In the `dependencies` section add the mct1 package. That section should look like this:

```
"dependencies": {
      "mct1": "https://github.com/mc-t1/mct1.git"
},
```

* Click "Save Spell". This loads MCT1 for you.

### Create a spell to start MCT1

* Click on "Spells" on the top menu.

* Click on "New Spell".

* Paste the following code into the spell, replacing the existing text:

```
const MCT1 = require('mct1').controller;

function mct1(command) {
    MCT1(command);
}
```

### Connect to a Magikcraft server

You can use one of the following servers to run MCT1:

* play.magikcraft.io
* au.open.magikcraft.io

If you have the Magikcraft client, just click on the "Play Magikcraft" button.

If you are using the Mojang client, then click on Add Server, and enter one of the above server addresses into the name and server address fields.

Connect to the server. When you appear in the Minecraft world, type `/spellbook`. You get a link in your console. Press 'T' to activate chat, then click on the link. Open the link in your web browser. This will connect your spellbook with your Minecraft account and allow you to run MCT1.

### Start MCT1

OK, now you're ready to run MCT1!

Press the 'T' key on your keyboard, then type in:

`/cast mct1 start`

This will start MCT1.

# How to develop MCT1
